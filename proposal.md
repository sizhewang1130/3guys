### steps 
1. Download bad data 
2. select related predictors
3. Allocate the Adj close one day after layoff announcement 
    - The number of media coverage of layoff
    - Calculate daily Return value (Ho-Non-Hypothesis)
4. Regression modeling
    - (Return Value ~ # of firms layoff news + # of sub-industry layoff news)-summary the model 
5. visualization
    - replot 
    - time series 
    - correlation plot 
6. Analysis
7. Report

## Necessary Data
1. The Observations should be Symbol.
2. Sample Period: Oct 2020 - Jul 2022.

### Now dataset and some changes of the dataset:
- We have cleaned data already provided by Parsa Ghaffari and Parsa Ghaffari in Kaggle.

- We need to calculate Daily Return Value, create dummy variables for news.

### The final dataset should include:
1. Date
